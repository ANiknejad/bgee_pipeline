## ZebrafishMine
* Why do we use a Python script for using intermine on ZFIN?
    => We were unable to make it work with the Perl scripts :/
* Queries with crossReference fields do not work
* "None" is the value for an empty field!
* sex information: "there will be very few direct annotations to ''female organism'' or ''male organism'' for mRNA _in situ_ hybridization experiments."  Leyla Ruzicka <leyla@zfin.org>
* "Wild-type (or standard) zebrafish is used by default. We use the ''WT'' designation if authors say they used a wild-type line but if they don't specify which wild-type line they used. As you know, some of the standard ''wild-type'' lines are not actually wild-type (for example TL https://zfin.org/action/genotype/view/ZDB-GENO-990623-2)."  Leyla Ruzicka <leyla@zfin.org>
