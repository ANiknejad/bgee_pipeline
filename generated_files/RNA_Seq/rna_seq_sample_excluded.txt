SRX618126	FALSE	Streaming failure during Kallisto step. 10M reads used instead of 51M. Rerun once with same result. Redownlaod not possible because problems with GTEx. This library can still be used because enough reads were mapped.	JR	2016-04-22
SRX616976	FALSE	Streaming failure during Kallisto step. 33M reads used instead of 43M. Rerun once with same result. Redownlaod not possible because problems with GTEx. This library can still be used because enough reads were mapped.	JR	2016-04-22
SRX099901	TRUE	Nematode sample with very few reads sequenced, and < 300,000 mapped. This is not enough to get good estimation of expression levels.	JR	2016-04-22
SRX589537	TRUE	Library with very low complexity, and a lot of duplicated reads from adapters. Excluded because very few reads mapped, not enough to get good estimation of expression levels.	JR	2016-04-22
SRX589538	TRUE	Library with only 132,987 reads sequenced. This is not enough to get good estimation of expression levels.	JR	2016-05-20
