Previous comment from JR was: This experiment (GSE22410) was made with a home-tuned protocol, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177965. But it seems in fact quite similar to other classical protocols, and it covers the whole transcriptome, so we include it. Other samples from the same experiment, made wiht other protocols might not be valid, but they were not retained in the WormBase annotations files (maybe for this reason)."	"ANN"	"2018-01-30"
