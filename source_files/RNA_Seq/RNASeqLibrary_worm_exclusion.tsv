"SRX028190"	"FALSE"	"This experiment (GSE22410) was made with a home-tuned protocol, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177965. But it seems in fact quite similar to other classical protocols, and it covers the whole transcriptome, so we include it. Other samples from the same experiment, made wiht other protocols might not be valid, but they were not retained in the WormBase annotations files (maybe for this reason)."	"JR"	"2016-03-15"
"SRX006984"	"FALSE"	"This experiment (GSE16552) is listed on GEO as Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing, but nothing on the description of the samples suggests this, so this is probably a mistake. The only thing is Library selection=size fractionation, but this could alos indicate fragment size selection, usually made on RNA-seq libraries. Wrote an email to GEO on Mar 15, 2016.
